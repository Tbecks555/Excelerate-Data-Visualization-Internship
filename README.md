# Excelerate-Data-Visualization-Internship
In this project, I collaborated with a team of seven to analyze and visualize marketing data for GlobalShala, delivering cost-saving recommendations on ad campaigns to the Finance team. I also designed and presented a compelling report, combining thoughtful analysis, clear visualizations, and effective presentation design to support better budget decisions.  

## Worked done so far
## Week 1
As part of the Data Visualization team, I collaborated with colleagues to perform exploratory data analysis and build visual dashboards that revealed key insights from the Marketing teamâ€™s ad campaign data. This analysis helped identify underperforming campaigns that should be discontinued, enabling the company to reduce unnecessary ad spend and reallocate the budget more effectively.
