# Excelerate-Data-Visualization-Internship
During this internship, I collaborated with a team of six to analyze and visualize marketing data for GlobalShala, delivering cost-saving recommendations on ad campaigns to the Finance team. I also designed and presented a compelling report, combining thoughtful analysis, clear visualizations, and effective presentation design to support better budget decisions.  

# Project Objectives
The main objective of the project was to pinpoint underperforming ad campaigns and recommend which should be discontinued and which should be optimized for better results.

# Tools Used:

1. **Python**: Performed data exploration, analysis, and visualization to identify underperforming ad campaigns.

2. **PowerPoint**: Presented findings, recommendations, and optimization strategies to GlobalShala’s Marketing and Finance teams.

# Insights generated from Analysis
For each visual, we applied data visualization best practices such as highlighting key data points, adding clear annotations, and using concise labels to make insights easy to understand.

## 1. Total Clicks by Ad Campaign

Here we observed the four ad campaigns with the lowest number of clicks, which means they generated less audience interaction and interest compared to other campaigns. They are the SHU_Students in Australia, Canada, UK, and USA.

## 2. Total Views (reach and impressions) by Ad Campaign

Here we observed the four ads with the lowest total views, which means they reached fewer people and had limited visibility compared to other campaigns. They include Canada, USA, Australia, and UK.

## 3. Average Frequency by Ad Campaign

The four ad campaigns highlighted had the lowest average frequency which means the targeted audiences saw the ads fewer times, potentially limiting recall and overall engagement. They include Australia, UK, USA and India.

## 4. Cost Per Result (CPR) and Cost Per Click (CPC)

The four ads in this chart had the highest CPR and CPC, which means they were the most expensive in terms of reaching and converting audiences. They include Australia, UK, UAE, and Canada.

## 5. ULC vs Amount Spent

The scatter plot shows green as cost-effective, orange as underperforming (e.g., Australia, UK), and gray as needing optimization for better results.

## 6. CTR and Unique CTR

Underperforming campaigns based on CTR and Unique CTR are Campaign 3 (Australia), 10 (UK), 1 (Educators and Principals), and 9 (UAE), indicating weaker audience engagement compared to other campaigns.

## 7. Cost Per Click (CPC) by Geography and Age

Poor cost efficiency is observed in older age groups in Australia and the UK, indicating higher costs with lower returns for these segments.

# Recommendations

Based on our analysis, We identified three ad campaigns that repeatedly showed low engagement and high costs, making them inefficient uses of the advertising budget. We recommend discontinuing these campaigns to reallocate resources toward higher-performing initiatives:

**1. SHU (Australia)** – Highest cost per result (CPR) with very low unique link clicks (ULC) and click-through rate (CTR). Overall reach and clicks were also low.

**2. SHU (UK)** – Extremely low engagement paired with a very high CPR, offering minimal return on investment.

**3. SHU (UAE)** – Moderate spending but poor returns, with low ULC and high CPR. Evidence of ad fatigue was present, as high frequency failed to generate strong engagement.


# Conclusion

We recommend discontinuing the Australia campaign due to its poor performance — the highest cost per result, very low clicks, and the weakest engagement overall, with a CTR of just 4.5% compared to nearly 10% in stronger markets like Nigeria.

While the UK and UAE campaigns also underperformed, their decent reach indicates audience interest. Their low engagement likely stems from ineffective targeting or ad fatigue rather than a lack of demand.

Instead of dropping them, we advise optimizing the UK and UAE campaigns by:

* **Refining Audience Targeting** – Show ads to the most relevant people to improve engagement.

* **Enhancing Ad Visuals** – Use appealing images/videos or student testimonials to build trust.

* **Testing Varied Formats** – Try different ad types (video, carousel) to see what performs best.

* **Adjusting Frequency** – Limit how often ads appear to avoid audience boredom.

By implementing these optimization strategies, we can increase engagement, reduce costs, and deliver stronger overall campaign performance moving forward.
